      "2023/09/21: Hi all, someone noticed that MeshRoom is not available for Mac OS. \
      It is a shame that they have not developed a version for Mac. They explain that it has something to do with the graphics engine. \
But don't worry, it is not going to be an issue for the rest of the term. This is the only time we are going to use a photogrammetric software, and it could be any. \
1. Partner with someone that has Windows or Linux OS and just process your photos there, or \
2. You can use the 1-month free trial of Agisoft Metashape that does the same: https://www.agisoft.com/downloads/installer/ \
Here is an example of using Metashape with Blender: https://youtu.be/rc4pUHolxgA?si=uhBv7dlkNm4RYgRz \
3. Whatever software works for you. Just do the research. I don't really care about the software, I just want you to be able to get a mesh. \
Please let me know if you have further questions.",

    The mesh/Three.js Assignment becomes Assignment 2 replacing quiz 2. Which means that we have 2 quizzes and 4 assignments worth 10 points each (click here to see the new evaluations schedule)`,
