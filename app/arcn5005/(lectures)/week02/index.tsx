Now our dialogue with design is in part mediated by computers.
This mediation occurs through multiple devices.
> There are different ways to interact with computers. 
> Physical input hardware. translate our body expressions into digital language. ¬† 
    > The mouse or touchscreen.
    > The Keyboard that allows us to type words that are then translated into machine code to get executed by the computer, that action is called programming. 
> Programming languages (notational systems written by humans or computers and executed by computers):
    > Low-level PLs: machine code = binary electromagnetic operations to interact with (CPU). Translated by decoders into binary code (sequences of 1s and 0s) yes, no / on, off / true, false. 
    > High-level PLs: Python,  C++, JavaScript, etc, which are how programmers express computational concepts. Based on spoken or written language (normally English) and are designed to translate our operations into machine code. 
> The mediators are called Interfaces.
  > Interfaces device or program that allow users to interact with the code. 
    > Text-based user interfaces (TUIs) use characters, text and symbols.
    > Graphical user interfaces (GUIs)‚Äîthey use icons and symbols, there is no code knowledge required, instead, ‚Äúthe user points, clicks on displays of virtual icons on the computer screen. the most popular interfaces for designers. Most BIM platforms are GUIs, The main way architects have to input their creativity process into the digital medium. makes the interaction with the computer more intuitive for the designers.
