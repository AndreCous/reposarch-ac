      "In 1973, Ivan Sutherland at MIT developed a program called ‚ÄòSketchpad‚Äô, which can be considered as the first computer drawing program or the first graphical user interface (GUI).\
       GUIs are human-computer interaction devices that allow users to interact with the computer through graphical icons instead of written code.\
       With a GUI the user can click or touch and manipulate the symbols displayed on the screen and thus, directly alter the program.\
       GUIs made computer more accessible for non-programmers, including architects.\
       Since then, GUIs are certainly the preferred vehicle for architects to interact with computers.",

          Sketchpad pioneered the graphical user interface (GUI), which allows

          coded commands. Instead, the user points, clicks, and double-clicks on
          displays of icons, the virtual tools on the screen.
